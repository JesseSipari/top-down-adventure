## About This Project

This project was developed as part of the [C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/) course by [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) and [Stephen Ulibarri](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephen-ulibarri-3/).

**Killerman2035** is a top-down action-adventure game where players wield a sword to battle different enemies. The project demonstrates fundamental C++ programming skills and game development techniques using the Raylib library.
